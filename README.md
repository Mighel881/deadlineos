## 🚀 What is DeadlineOS?

**DeadlineOS** is a fully browser-based productivity OS that combines AI-powered task management, crisis detection, mood tracking, and gamification — all without requiring a single login or installation.

Built for people who don't just want *another* to-do app. Built for people who are **in the middle of it**.

Most productivity tools show you a list. DeadlineOS **decides with you.**

```
Normal tool:    "You have 7 tasks."

DeadlineOS:     "Task X is blocking your team. Start now, 90 minutes,
                 no multitasking. Deploy can wait until 16:00 — you've got this."
```

One click on **AI Analysis** and Claude reads your tasks, deadlines, mood and energy simultaneously — and delivers a precise action plan. No account. No setup. Everything runs in the browser.

---

## 🏁 How to Use

1. **Open** `index.html` in any modern browser — no server needed
2. **Click** `Open App →` to launch the main app
3. **Add tasks** with deadlines, priorities and assignees
4. **Click** `🎬 Demo` for an instant demo with 6 pre-loaded tasks
5. **Chat** with the AI Commander to get a prioritized action plan
6. **Watch** the Crisis Radar detect and alert on deadline collisions

> 💡 Everything is saved automatically in your browser via LocalStorage — your data survives page reloads.

## 🤖 AI Commander

DeadlineOS features a **smart AI** powered by Claude Sonnet that understands your full context — tasks, deadlines, mood, energy and team status — all at once.

The AI understands natural language and responds intelligently to:

- 📊 **Task analysis** — *"analyze my tasks"*, *"what should I focus on?"*
- 🚨 **Crisis detection** — *"am I in crisis?"*, *"what's on fire?"*
- ⏰ **Deadline help** — *"which deadlines are critical?"*, *"help me prioritize"*
- 👥 **Team management** — *"who is overloaded?"*, *"team status"*
- ⚡ **Productivity coaching** — *"how can I be more productive?"*, *"I'm overwhelmed"*
- 🍅 **Pomodoro guidance** — *"start a focus session"*, *"I need a break"*
